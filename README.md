# FortiSOAR SOC Simulator 

  

The FortiSOAR SOC Simulator connector is used to create various scenarios. To configure this connector, open the FortiSOAR SOC Simulator Connector and in its "Configuration > Page" enter the following values for the configuration parameters   

  

- **Configuration Name**: Provide a name for this configuration and you can optionally mark this configuration as the “Default Configuration”.  

- **Import Scenarios**: Select this checkbox to import various scenarios.  

- **Load Threat Intelligence**: Whenever records are recreated for a scenario, they include known malicious indicators, such as IP addresses, file hash, etc. Selecting this checkbox randomly assigns the malicious indicators to records every time a record is created. Therefore, the records get created with new indicators each time.   

  

Once you have configured the FortiSOAR SOC Simulator connector, sample scenarios get created in Help > Scenario and now, you are all set to start using the content pack and creating demo records.  

  

### Contributing Scenario 

  

First you will have to fork git repo https://github.com/fortinet-fortisoar/connector-fortisoar-soc-simulator. Here you will create a folder, aptly named as per your usecase,  under 'scenarios' folder. 

The folder that you will create should contain two files 

> **scenario_record.json** 

   This file is scenario record 


> **scenarion_configuration.json** 

   This file is configuration export for a scenario 


Lets discuss process in brief 

- ##### Design 

   - Design your scenario of ForiSOAR instance. Here you will create demo records , module , system view changes along with required playbooks. Apart from this , we need to create a 'Scenario Record'. This record will be launch point for scenario. Please check 'Scenario Record' section to see how to a create a Scenario Record. 

- ##### Exporting Scenario 

   - You can export secenario by selecting scneario record and execute playbook  - *Export  Scenario* 

- ##### Exporting Scenario Configuration 

   - You can export required configuration for a scenario using 'Configuration Export' option listed under 'Application Editor' 

      - Here you export required module schema along with system view template, playbook collection , connector , users / team ,etc  

  

#### Creating Scenario Record

 A scenario record contains Title, Description and steps

There are two ways to create a scenario record steps.

- Record which refer playbook to create a scenario demo record 

- Record which has demo record JSON playload. This method also allows user to add a placeholder for some values which can be replaced dynamically  

  

##### Scenario record referring playbook for creation of demo record  

While creating scenario add following in 'steps' section  . Replace values at appropriate location  

<p> 

{ 

  "Steps": [ 

    { 

      "name": "<<Name of Scenario>>", 

      "type": "executePlaybook",  << -- this tells we want to create demo record invoking a  playbook and  not alert record JSON 

      "playbookIRI": "/api/3/workflows/<<GUID>>",  << -- IRI of playbook   

      "preCreateMessage": "<<Message you want to display before creation of demo record>>", 

      "postCreateMessage": "<<Message you want to display after creation of demo record>>", 

      "waitTimeforNextStep": "<<time in seconds to delay next step>>" 

    } 

  ] 

} 

</p> 

  

>Complete Example 

<p> 

{ 

  "Steps": [ 

    { 

      "name": "Concurrent Successful Authentications", 

      "type": "executePlaybook", 

      "playbookIRI": "/api/3/workflows/37603f90-ab2c-42a0-b183-50e92fdd2fd1", 

      "preCreateMessage": "Creating demo record for Concurrent Successful Authentications", 

      "postCreateMessage": "", 

      "waitTimeforNextStep": "5" 

    } 

  ] 

} 

</p> 

Note : Here we cannot set placeholder for a value to replaced dynamically while creation of demo record  

  

##### Scenario record referring alert playload 

  

While creating scenario add following in 'steps section' . Replace values at appropriate location  

<p> 

{ 

  "Steps": [ 

    { 

      "name": "<<Name of Scenario>>", 

      "type": "createAlert",    << -- this tells we want to create demo record using alert record JSON and not playbook 

      "alertFields": { 

        <<<Alert Record JSON>>> 

      }, 

      "preCreateMessage": "<<Message you want to display before creation of demo record>>", 

      "postCreateMessage": "none", 

      "waitTimeforNextStep": "<<time in seconds to delay next step>>" 

    } 

  ] 

}

# 1.0.9 Change log:

## New Action: Create Malicious File Indicator:

- Creates a Zero day Docx file as a file indicator
- Zero day means each run the resulting file has a unique hash code
- The action accepts email and URL parameters to be embedded within the file, users can then extract it via **File Content Extraction connector**

## New Action: Create Simulated Alert

- A dynamically generated Alert based on alert JSON definition, users can copy an alert defintion from FortiSOAR WebUI such as a response of 'GET /api/3/alerts/387dc349-b0c6-4317-a44c-0a83f7637cb5', replace some static entries such as timestamps, IP addresses, usernames ...etc with variables (Tags) so the action would replace these variables and then creates a new simulated alert

## New Indicators source: Moved all indicartor downloads to AlienVault OTX

## Variables (Tags) now accept parameters

- Variables such as TR_RANDOM_INTEGER, can now be written as: TR_RANDOM_INTEGER,10,20 so the value of the variable will be a random # between 10 and 20, similarily TR_ASSET_IP can now take a network address so its value will be a random IP from that subnet, exp: TR_ASSET_IP, would yield: 192.168.100.X, X between 2,240
